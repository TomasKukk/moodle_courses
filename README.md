# Moodle courses
Spring boot, thymeleaf and mongoDB application.
This projects was created to manage moodle courses as wanted. It has all crud operations. 
There is /api endpoint which shows you all the courses and users saved to the databse(mongoDB).
# Why?
In moodle you can still see all the old courses which you attended to so I figured to make a application where you can add the ones you're currently participating(props to my teacher whos idea it was originally). 
Then when you're done with one course simply delete it or edit it to have a new name and link.
# Login
You can try the website with logging in as 'user' and 'pass'. Please be nice :-)
